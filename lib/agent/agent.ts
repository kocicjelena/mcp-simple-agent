🚨 CRITICAL: HOW TO WORK WITH THIS USER (READ FIRST - EVERY SESSION)
New tasks can be found in the GitHub Issues for this project.

Core Working Principles - NEVER FORGET THESE
BE A SYSTEMATIC CODE ANALYST, NOT A GUESSER

ALWAYS search for existing code patterns, dependencies, and conflicts BEFORE attempting fixes
Use grep, find, and comprehensive code analysis to understand root causes systematically
Don't apply "band-aid" fixes - identify and solve the underlying architectural issue
Leverage your file search and cross-reference capabilities instead of making the user debug manually
This applies to CSS, JavaScript, database queries, API endpoints, configuration - EVERYTHING
THINK LIKE AN EXPERT WITH DEEP SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE

Consider how changes affect the entire system: dependencies, imports, inheritance, scoping
Look for naming conflicts, architectural patterns, and existing conventions
Analyze the broader codebase structure and established patterns before making changes
Understand the user is building maintainable, scalable, isolated components
Apply this expertise to ALL aspects: styling, logic, data flow, security, performance
ISOLATION AND CONSISTENCY ARE SACRED

Never use generic names that could conflict across components (CSS classes, function names, etc.)
Every component should follow established naming conventions and scoping patterns
Prevent any kind of bleeding/conflicts between components at all costs
Example: Use .collection-table-header-content not .header-content, handleCollectionSort not handleSort
METHODOLOGY: SEARCH → ANALYZE → SOLVE (FOR EVERYTHING)

Step 1: Search codebase for related patterns, existing implementations, potential conflicts
Step 2: Analyze root cause using systematic thinking and architectural understanding
Step 3: Implement the correct solution that follows established patterns
Always explain your analysis process to build trust and demonstrate thoroughness
RESPECT THE USER'S EXPERTISE AND TIME

This user knows when you're applying band-aids vs real solutions (in any domain)
They can see issues in dev tools, logs, databases - you should find them systematically in code
Don't frustrate them by forgetting established working patterns or architectural decisions
Learn from their corrections immediately and apply those lessons to ALL similar situations
If you forget these principles, you will frustrate this user immensely. Read this section at the start of every session.

🚨 CORE OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
Important Facts & Credentials
Database password: Password123
Admin user: cardcollector@jeffblankenburg.com / testpassword
You never need to start or restart the servers. Ever.
🚨 Database Location & Connection (CRITICAL - NEVER FORGET!)
Location: Docker container named collect-cards-db
Image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
Port: localhost:1433 (mapped from container)
Connection: sqlserver://localhost:1433;database=CollectYourCards;user=sa;password=Password123;...
Current Status: ✅ FULLY RESTORED - 793,740 cards, 6,965 players, 135 teams
Commands:
docker ps - check container status
docker logs collect-cards-db - view SQL Server logs
lsof -i :1433 - verify port usage
Critical UI/UX Rules
NEVER USE JAVASCRIPT ALERTS - Always use toast messages or inline error displays instead
NO MANUAL PAGINATION - Never implement manual pagination (Previous/Next buttons, page numbers). Always use infinite scrolling for better UX
ADMIN TABLES FIRST COLUMN: Always show database ID as first column in all admin tables for debugging/query purposes
Use toast notifications for all success/error feedback
Prefer inline validation and error messages in forms
📱 Responsive Design Requirements (MANDATORY)
MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH: Every page MUST work perfectly on mobile devices (320px+)
REQUIRED BREAKPOINTS: 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px+
TOUCH-FRIENDLY: Minimum 44px touch targets for buttons/links
NO HORIZONTAL SCROLL: Never allow horizontal scrolling on any screen size
GRID RESPONSIVENESS: Use auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr) or smaller for mobile compatibility
NAVIGATION: Must remain accessible on all screen sizes (implement hamburger menu for mobile)
TESTING REQUIREMENT: Test every page at 320px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px widths
🚨 Core Development Standards (NEVER VIOLATE)
1. Feature Request Management
RECORD EVERY REQUEST: All feature requests, no matter how small, must be documented immediately
ORGANIZED TRACKING: Keep feature lists organized, prioritized, and tidy
COMPLETION TRACKING: Mark features as completed when delivered
2. Database Protection (CRITICAL)
NEVER DELETE DATABASE: Under no circumstances delete the database without explicit instruction
NEVER DELETE RECORDS: Do not delete database records without explicit user permission
BACKUP BEFORE CHANGES: Always ensure data safety before schema modifications
AUDIT ALL CHANGES: Log all database modifications for accountability
DATABASE CHANGES TRACKING:
DATABASE_CHANGE_TRACKING.md - Complete change log for production
DATABASE_CHANGES_FOR_PRODUCTION.sql - Ready-to-run SQL for production
Every database change MUST be documented in tracking file immediately
3. Database ID Privacy (ABSOLUTE RULE)
NEVER SHOW DATABASE IDS: Database IDs must NEVER be shown in URLs or on screen
NO ID EXPOSURE: Do not expose internal database IDs to users under any circumstances
USE ALTERNATIVE IDENTIFIERS: Use slugs, natural keys, or other user-friendly identifiers instead
4. Test-Driven Development (MANDATORY)
TESTS BEFORE CODE: Always write tests before implementing new features
ALL TESTS MUST PASS: Before writing new code, ensure all existing tests pass
NEW TESTS MUST PASS: New code must make the new tests pass
NO UNTESTED CODE: Every feature must have corresponding test coverage
5. CI/CD Pipeline (ZERO FAILURES)
CLEAN PIPELINE: Maintain clean CI/CD between local → GitHub → Azure production
NO FAILED GATES: GitHub CI/CD integration gates must never fail
AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT: Ensure seamless deployment process
ROLLBACK CAPABILITY: Always maintain ability to rollback changes
6. Code Quality Standards
NO CLEVER CODE: Avoid clever/complex solutions in favor of clear, understandable code
CONSISTENT NAMING: Use clear, consistent naming conventions throughout
READABLE CODE: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
UNIFORM PATTERNS: Follow established patterns consistently across codebase
7. Production Synchronization (CRITICAL)
IMMEDIATE DOCUMENTATION: Document all dev changes that need production updates
SCHEMA CHANGES: Track all database schema modifications for production
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: Document new/changed .env requirements
CONFIGURATION UPDATES: Track all config changes needed in production
DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST: Maintain checklist of production update requirements
PRODUCTION_CHANGES_NEEDED.md - List of pending production updates
Data Field Conventions
Team names: Use team.name only (already includes city) - do NOT concatenate with team.city
Player names: Use first_name + last_name format
Location fields: location (name) and location_id (ID) - maintain both for proper display and updates
Color columns: Always center-align color value tags in table columns (textAlign: 'center')
🔧 TECHNICAL REFERENCE
Current Architecture
Frontend: React with Vite
Backend: Express.js with Prisma ORM
Database: SQL Server 2022 running in Docker container
Authentication: Comprehensive JWT-based system with email verification
Email Service: Azure Communication Services
Security: Rate limiting, password hashing (bcrypt), account lockout protection
Hosting: Azure App Service (Production)
📊 SQL Server Schema Reference
⚠️ BIGINT SERIALIZATION RULES (CRITICAL)
ALL BigInt fields MUST be converted to Number or String before JSON response:
